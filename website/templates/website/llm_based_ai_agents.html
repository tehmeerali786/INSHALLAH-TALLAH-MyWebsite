                  <p> Deloitte has predicted, “in 2025, 25% of companies that use gen AI will launch agentic AI pilots or proofs of concept, and this figure will grow to 50% in 2027” </p>

                  <p> We have been studying and practicing LangChain. In deep learning, we are involved since 2017 and covered all the related mathematics. Therefore, we are proud to say that we are ready to build llm (large language models) based AI (Artificial Intelligence) agents for companies and research firms. </p>

                  <p> LangChain enable use to use too many llms, including OpenAI GPT-4.0, Google Gemini 2.0, all HuggingFace Models (this includes Meta (Facebook) Llama as well), DeepSeek and much more. </p>  

                  <p> Our agents not only can generate and build textual content, instead they can create pictures for designers as well.</p> 

                  <p> Obviously, we can fine-tune them according to your business needs and build adept agents for your profession processes. </p> 

                  <p> Why I need an AI agent? This is the question that comes in everyone’s mind. Basically, your firm or institution needs AI agents in one of these two following scenarios: </p>

                  <ol>

                        <li> If you are a big firm or an institution, your business needs AI agents to support and shift the burden from your workers. This enables your business to produce and perform 10 times more than your business does. 

                        Just imagine that you are a busy law firm. Now, your paralegals can just oversee AI agents (complete virtual employees) doing online initial investigation, legal research. After that these AI agents draft research documents and analysis memorandums. These AI agents can perform all these tasks much more accurately and in a fraction of a time. </li>

                        <li> If you are a starting professional with small budget, you can just pay equal to one month salary and create a whole AI agent. 

                        Imagine yourself an attorney and or an accountant who just opened an office or doing work from home. To expand, you need to take much more work than you can perform. So, instead of hiring a full time paralegal or a junior accountant, you hire our firm to build you an AI agent (complete virtual employees)) that work like assistant for you and do all the work. Then, the only job you will have to oversee the returning work. This way, you can perform 10 times more and use retained earning to expand your business. </li>

                  </ol>

                  <p> We can build amazing AI agents of all kind for knowledge intensive professions. This includes the following:</p>

                  

                  <ul>

                      <li> Purchasers and Selleters, like Car Dealers </li>
                      <li> Venture Capitalists and Private Equity Firms </li>
